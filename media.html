        <h2>Dear me,</h2>
        <p>
          As Michelle Obama has shown through her journey, I too can rise above
          challenges, break barriers, and carve my own path. She once said,
          "Your story is what you have, what you will always have. It is
          something to own." Just as she embraced her story with confidence, I
          will embrace mine—fully, unapologetically, and with purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          She turned obstacles into stepping stones, proving that resilience and
          hard work can open doors once thought impossible. If she could use her
          voice to inspire change, I too can use my skills and passion to make
          an impact. Whether in technology, design, or the challenges ahead, I
          have the power to create, to lead, and to inspire others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like Michelle, I refuse to be limited by expectations. I will keep
          learning, keep pushing, and keep striving for excellence—because I am
          capable, I am strong, and I am becoming everything I am meant to be.
        </p>
